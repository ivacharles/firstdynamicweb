This is to explain how I would determine a winner for the TicTacToe game

split this Array of data ["X", "O", "X", "O", "X", "O", "?", "?", "X"]  into 3 Arrays
x o x
o x o
? ? x

if( everything in the 1st array is = "x" OR everything in the 1st array is = "o" )
    there is a winner and it is 1stArray[0]

if( everything in the 2nd array is = "x" OR everything in the 2nd array is = "o" )
    there is a winner and it is 1stArray[0]
if( everything in the 3rd array is = "x" OR everything in the 3dr array is = "o" )
    there is a winner and it is 1stArray[0]

if(1stArray[0] = 2ndArray[0] = 3rdArray[0])
    there is a winner and it is 1stArray[0]
if(1stArray[1] = 2ndArray[1] = 3rdArray[1])
    there is a winner and it is 1stArray[1]
if(1stArray[2] = 2ndArray[2] = 3rdArray[2])
    there is a winner and it is 1stArray[2]

if(1stArray[0] = 2ndArray[1] = 3rdArray[2])
    there is a winner and it is 1stArray[0]
